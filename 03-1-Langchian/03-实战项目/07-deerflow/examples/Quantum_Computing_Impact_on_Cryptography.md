### Overview

Quantum computing poses a significant threat to modern cryptography. Quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover's can break or weaken widely used encryption methods. This necessitates the development and adoption of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. This report provides an overview of the impact of quantum computing on existing cryptographic algorithms and explores potential solutions like post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).

### Detailed Analysis

#### Vulnerabilities of Classical Cryptography

Classical cryptographic algorithms rely on mathematical problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve but are vulnerable to quantum algorithms.

| Algorithm | Vulnerability | Quantum Algorithm | Impact                                                              |
| :-------- | :------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RSA       | Factoring     | Shor's Algorithm  | Efficient factorization of large numbers, breaking RSA encryption   |
| ECC       | Discrete Log  | Shor's Algorithm  | Efficiently solves discrete logarithm problems, breaking ECC encryption |
| AES       | Brute Force   | Grover's Algorithm| Reduces the search space, weakening AES security; AES-256 is stronger |

Shor's algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers, rendering RSA and ECC useless if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed [http://greekcrisis.net/shors-algorithm-quantum-computers/]. Breaking RSA-2048 requires approximately 4000 qubits, and ECC-256 requires about 2500 qubits [https://ej-compute.org/index.php/compute/article/view/146].

Grover's algorithm reduces the brute-force search space for AES, weakening its security [https://ej-compute.org/index.php/compute/article/view/146]. AES-256 is more secure against quantum attacks than AES-128 or AES-192 [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not].

#### Quantum Computational Resources

Breaking RSA-2048 requires around 4000 qubits and millions of gate operations, potentially achievable within the next decade [https://ej-compute.org/index.php/compute/article/view/146]. A quantum computer breaking RSA-2048 in hours could be built by 2030 for around a billion dollars [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/102671/is-aes-128-quantum-safe]. IBM has a 1121-qubit 'Condor' processor, with leading platforms aiming for two-qubit gate fidelity in the range of 99.9% to 99.99% [https://methodologists.net/Exploring-the-Transformative-Advancements-in-Quantum-Computing-and-Their-Global-Impact-in-2024].

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) involves developing cryptographic algorithms that are secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography].

**PQC Algorithm Types**

| Algorithm Type       | Examples                                  | Characteristics                                                              |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lattice-based        | CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, NTRU | Based on the hardness of lattice problems                                    |
| Multivariate         | Rainbow                                   | Based on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations |
| Hash-based           | SPHINCS+                                  | Based on the security of cryptographic hash functions                         |
| Code-based           | Classic McEliece                          | Based on the difficulty of decoding general linear codes                       |
| Isogeny-based        | CSIDH                                     | Based on isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves                        |
| Symmetric Key Quantum Resistance | AES and SNOW 3G                     | Post quantum resistance to known Symmetric Key Quantum resistance attacks |

PQC algorithms often require larger key sizes compared to pre-quantum algorithms [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography].

**NIST Standardization**

NIST is conducting a Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process to select PQC algorithms [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography]. NIST has released the first three finalized post-quantum encryption standards: CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM), CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA), and SPHINCS+ [https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards].

#### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD offers a method for secure key exchange leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics [https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Vol16-issue2/Version-11/A0162110109.pdf]. Eavesdropping introduces detectable anomalies due to the disturbance of the quantum system [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution].

**QKD Protocols**

| Protocol | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| BB84     | First QKD protocol |
| E91      | Uses entangled photons |
| COW      | Coherent One Way |

Practical challenges include secret key rate, distance, size, cost, and practical security [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05853]. The NSA views quantum-resistant cryptography (PQC) as a more cost-effective and easily maintained solution than QKD for securing data in National Security Systems [https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/Quantum-Key-Distribution-QKD-and-Quantum-Cryptography-QC/].

#### Hybrid Approaches

Hybrid security systems integrating PQC and QKD are being explored [https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//IG.18-Hybrid-QKD-and-PQC-security-scenarios-and-use-cases-Whitepaper-v1.0-002.pdf]. Network operators are expected to spend over $6 billion on QKD development and implementation between 2025 and 2030 [https://smartinfrastructuremagazine.com/news/quantum-key-distribution-network-operators-to-spend-6-3-billion-over-next-six-years].

#### Risk Assessment and Timelines

Quantum computing advancements are progressing, creating an urgent need to transition to quantum-safe alternatives [https://ej-compute.org/index.php/compute/article/view/146]. Cryptographic vulnerabilities may emerge within the next 5â€“10 years [https://ej-compute.org/index.php/compute/article/view/146].
