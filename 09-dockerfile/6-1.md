> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea
> - a group of cochlear malformations with normal external dimensions and various internal architecture defects. Incomplete partitions constitute 37% of inner ear malformations according to the database of Hacettepe University Department of Otolaryngology. There are three different types of incomplete partition groups according to the defect in the modiolus and the interscalar septa.

**Slide 2:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ① Incomplete partition type I (IP-I)
> - This is the type of the cochlea described in “cystic cochleovestibular malformation” by Sennaroglu and Saatci in 2002. They represent approximately 11.5% of inner ear malformations.
> - In this anomaly there is a clear differentiation between cochlea and vestibule. Cochlea is located in its usual location in the anterolateral part of the fundus of the IAC and lacks the entire modiolus and interscalar septa, giving the appearance of an empty cystic structure. External dimensions (height and length) of an IP-I cochlea are similar to normal cases. Cochlea is accompanied by an enlarged, dilated vestibule.

**Slide 3:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ① Incomplete partition type I (IP-I)
> - Vestibular aqueduct enlargement is very rare. There may be a defect between the IAC and the cochlea due to developmental abnormality of the cochlear aperture and absence of the modiolus, and CSF may completely fill the cochlea. A recent histopathology study suggests that IP-I may be due to endosteal development abnormality as a result of defective vascular supply coming from the IAC.
> - The majority of IP-I patients have severe to profound SNHL. They are almost always candidates for CI if they have a CN. In case of CN aplasia in IP-I, an ABI is indicated.

---

**Slide 4:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ① Incomplete partition type I (IP-I)
> - Recurrent meningitis can occur in IP-I patients even prior to their CI surgery or in their non-operated ear. This due to defective stapes footplate and CSF filling the cochlea is easily infected during an attack of otitis media. This is very characteristic for IP-I. Spontaneous CSF fistula and recurrent meningitis can be seen although less frequently in cochlear hypoplasia type II. This is because both IP-I and CH-II have endosteal developmental anomaly leading to defective footplate development.
> - All patients with IP-I and recurrent meningitis who have normal tympanic membranes but fluid filling the middle ear and mastoid should have an exploration of the middle ear with special attention to the stapes footplate.

---

**Slide 5:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ② Incomplete partition type II (IP-II)
> - The apical part of the modiolus and the corresponding interscalar septa are defective, giving the apex of the cochlea a cystic appearance due to the confluence of middle and apical turns. The external dimensions of the cochlea (height and diameter) are similar to that seen in normal cases.
> - As already pointed out by Sennaroglu and Saatci, it is not correct to define this anomaly as a cochlea with 1.5 turns. The term “cochlea with 1.5 turns” is more appropriate for cochlear hypoplasia (particularly CH-III). They represent 22.5% of IEMs in our database.

---

**Slide 6:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ② Incomplete partition type II (IP-II)
> - In IP-II, the apical part of the modiolus is defective, giving rise to a cystic cochlear apex with normal external dimensions.
> - This anomaly was originally described by Carlo Mondini and together with a minimally dilated vestibule and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) constitutes the triad of the Mondini Deformity. The term “Mondini” should be used only if the above-mentioned triad of malformations is present.

---

**Slide 7:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ② Incomplete partition type II (IP-II)
> - A recent study on histopathology demonstrated that modiolar defects may be due to high CSF pressure transmission into the inner ear as a result of EVA. An enlarged endolymphatic sac and duct appears to be the genetic abnormality that is causing other abnormalities allowing high CSF pressure to be transmitted into the inner ear. This results in a mild dilatation in the walls of the vestibule. However, no hydropic changes were observed in the endolymphatic space.
> - If there is higher pressure, it is natural to expect more destruction at the upper, and possibly the lower part of the modiolus. This is the reason for the CSF oozing and gusher sometimes observed during CI surgery.

**Slide 8:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ② Incomplete partition type II (IP-II)
> - Management
>   - At a young age, these patients may have near normal hearing and usually do not require amplification initially.
>   - With progressive hearing loss, they become candidates for hearing aid.
>   - Usually progression in hearing loss continues, ultimately creating a need for CI at some point in the future. High pulsating CSF pressure may be responsible for the progression of hearing loss. A role for head trauma has been suggested, and these patients are advised to avoid trauma by wearing helmets when playing sports and avoiding contact sports completely.

**Slide 9:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ② Incomplete partition type II (IP-II)
> - Audiological Findings: These patients do not have a characteristic hearing level, as their audiometric threshold testing varies from normal to profound. The hearing loss can be symmetric or asymmetric, but it is usually progressive. It is also possible to have sudden SNHL. Audiological findings may be due to pressure transmission via EVA into the inner ear.

---

**Slide 10:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ③ Incomplete partition type III (IP-III)
> - Cochlea in IP-III has interscalar septa but the modiolus is completely absent.
> - The external dimensions of the cochlea (height and diameter) are not different from the normal.
> - IP-III is the type of anomaly present in X-linked deafness.
> - IP-III constitutes 2.9% of the IEMs.
> - In IP-III there may be mixed type HL or profound SNHL. Conductive component may be due to thin otic capsule. Stapes surgery should be avoided in this group. It may lead to gusher and further SNHL.
> - They have excellent cochlear nerves. Therefore, ABI is not indicated in this group of incomplete partitions.

---

**Slide 11:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 6) Incomplete Partition Anomalies of the Cochlea  
> ③ Incomplete partition type III (IP-III)
> - Management
>   - MHL gives the impression of stapedial fixation. Stapedotomy results in severe gusher and further SNHL, should be avoided.
>   - Patients with severe HL are candidates for CI. Because of the absent modiolus in IP-III, all patients have severe gusher during CI surgery and there is a chance of electrode misplacement into IAC. The position of the electrode should be checked intraoperatively in all cases.
>   - Modiolar hugging electrodes have more chance to enter into IAC and they should be avoided in the surgery of IP-III.
>   - Spontaneous CSF fistula through the stapes footplate and recurrent meningitis is very rare in IP-III in spite of high volume CSF leak during CI surgery.


**Slide 1:**

>
> 7) Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct (EVA)
> - EVA (i.e., the midpoint between posterior labyrinth and operculum is larger than 1.5 mm) in the presence of a normal cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals
> - Audiological presentation and management is similar to that of IP-II.
> - Management
>   - Initially they may have near-normal hearing.
>   - With progressive hearing loss, HA use may be necessary.
>   - Hearing loss is progressive and they may be candidate for CI later in their life.
>   - As in IP-II high pulsating CSF pressure may be responsible for the progression of hearing loss.
>   - These patients are also advised to avoid head trauma and wear helmets during sports.

**Slide 2:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 8) Cochlear Aperture Abnormalities
> - Cochlear aperture (CA), cochlear fossette, or bony cochlear nerve canal transmits the cochlear nerve from the cochlea to IAC.
> - This can be visualized in the midmodiolar view as well as coronal sections on HRCT.
> - CA is considered hypoplastic if the width is less than 1.4 mm.
> - CA is considered to be aplastic when the canal is completely replaced by bone or there is no canal on midmodiolar view.
> - CA aplasia is typically accompanied by cochlear nerve aplasia. CN may be hypoplastic or aplastic when CA is hypoplastic. CA hypoplasia and aplasia can also be observed in a normal cochlea.
> - CA abnormalities may be accompanied by a narrow IAC on HRCT. IAC is considered narrow if the width of the midpoint of the IAC is smaller than 2.5 mm.

**Slide 3:**

> 9) Cochlear Nerve Abnormalities  
> ② Hypoplastic CN
> - There is a separate CN but the size is less than the contralateral normal CN or ipsilateral normal facial nerve. On direct parasagittal imaging CN appears to have a smaller diameter than ipsilateral FN.
> - CN hypoplasia can be subdivided into two groups:  
>   Type I: CN is definitely present and it can be followed easily into the cochlea but its size is smaller in diameter when compared to ipsilateral FN and contralateral normal CN. CI is definitely indicated in this situation  
>   Type II: CN is extremely thin and hardly visible and on axial MRI it can be scarcely followed into the cochlea (<10% of the normal CN or ipsilateral FN). These are the cases where a decision between CI and ABI has to be made.

**Slide 4:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 8) Cochlear Aperture Abnormalities
> - Narrow IAC can accompany other malformations or with a normal cochlea. In cases of narrow IAC, MRI should be obtained to demonstrate if CN is normal, aplastic, or hypoplastic. Axial and sagittal oblique high T2-weighted (i.e., CISS, FIESTA, etc.) images are necessary for this purpose. On sagittal oblique MR sections, four distinct nerves can be visualized in the IAC. In CN aplasia, no nerve can be identified in the anterior inferior part of the IAC. Please refer to the next section for a more detailed discussion on cochlear nerve abnormalities.

**Slide 6:**

>
> 8) Cochlear Aperture Abnormalities  
> - Audiological Findings
> - Severe to profound SNHL is usually present. As the cochlea is normal, otoacoustic emissions (OAE) may be present and the child may pass newborn hearing screening if automated ABR is not obtained. Their hearing loss is typically discovered later on in childhood based on the family’s concerns of lack of sound awareness and language development. If the newborn screening protocol involves OAE and automated ABR, this malformation can be diagnosed during infancy. Diagnostic audiological evaluation will reveal profound hearing loss.

**Slide 7:**

> 8) Cochlear Aperture Abnormalities  
> - Management
>   - Hearing aids usually do not provide sufficient amplification in patients with CA hypoplasia and aplasia.
>   - In patients with bilateral hypoplastic CA with hypoplastic cochlear nerve, hearing aid trial is necessary.
>   - If this does not provide adequate functional hearing, these patients usually become candidates for CI. The family should be counseled that if CI does not provide sufficient hearing in terms of auditory perception, contralateral ABI may be necessary to achieve improved audiologic and language outcomes.
>   - In CA aplasia, ABI is indicated as first-line therapy.

**Slide 8:**

>
> 9) Cochlear Nerve Abnormalities  
> ④ Normal CVN
> - Normally cochlear and vestibular nerves originate at the brainstem together forming the CVN. CVN then separates into CN and superior and inferior vestibular nerves in the IAC.
> - In cases of common cavity, CVN enters the cavity without separating into individual nerves. With radiological precision at the present time, it is impossible to determine the cochlear fiber content in the CVN but if the size is 1.5–2 times as much as the ipsilateral FN or similar to contralateral normal CVN it can be accepted as normal.

**Slide 9:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 9) Cochlear Nerve Abnormalities
> - The classification of cochleovestibular nerve is also important in the management of IEMs.
> - Sennaroglu L proposes the following classification for CN and CVN abnormalities in IEMs.
> ① Normal cochlear nerve (CN)
> - It is important to trace the CN until it enters the cochlea on lower axial sections passing through the IAC. On parasagittal sections, there is a separate CN located in the anterior inferior part of the IAC, entering the cochlea. The size of the cochlear nerve is similar in size when compared with the CN on the contralateral normal side. According to parasagittal view, the size of the CN is larger than the ipsilateral FN.

> Hypoplastic cochlear nerve (CN). (a) Separate CN but the size is less than ipsilateral normal facial nerve. (b) On direct parasagittal imaging CN appears to have a smaller diameter than ipsilateral FN. (c) Bilateral extremely thin and hardly visible CN



**Slide 10:**
> **3. Inner ear malformations**
>
> 9) Cochlear Nerve Abnormalities  
> ⑤ Hypoplastic CVN
> - If CVN is smaller than contralateral CVN or ipsilateral FN, it can be accepted as hypoplastic. CVN hypoplasia is particularly important in CC.
> ⑥ Absent CVN
> - In case of Michel deformity with absent IAC, CVN is also absent. Only FN can be identified.
>

(c) Absent CVN in case of Michel deformity with absent IAC, CVN is also absent. Only FN can be identified (FN = Facial nerve, IAC = Internal auditory canal)


**Slide 51:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - Proper positioning is achieved by elevating the shoulders. With this, the head lies in line with the rest of the body, and the neck can be extended properly.
> - On the contralateral side of the head, a soft pad is placed, so free movement of the head is prevented, and pressure over the skin is distributed.
> - Continuous facial nerve monitoring is used.
> - Initially, templates are used to plan the site for the receiver stimulator, so that it will lie behind the external processor, and above the inferior orbital – superior meatal (Frankfort horizontal) and temporal line.
> - Incision is drawn a half way between the postauricular sulcus and the front of the receiver-stimulator package, so the incision will not cross the internal package. This location is particularly advantageous for young children, since it prevents damage to the more superficially located facial nerve at its exit point.
> - Local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor is injected along the incision line. The front edge of the receiver-stimulator site is marked with a transcutaneous injection of methylene blue dye, approximately 4.5–5 cm. from EAC, in a 30–45° angle.

---

**Slide 52:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - After prepping and draping, the skin incision is made down to temporalis fascia, and an anteriorly based scalp flap is elevated.
> - A fibroperiosteal incision is then made, close to EAC, from the mastoid tip to the temporalis line, and then backwards towards the superior end of the skin incision. This allows a posteriorly based fibroperiosteal flap to be elevated and the mastoid cortex exposed.
> - Usually all soft tissue work is performed with cold knife dissection and bipolar cautery.
> - A cortical mastoidectomy is then performed in the usual fashion, taking care to identify the middle fossa dural plate and to define the sinodural angle. An overhang of cortical bone can be left superiorly and posteriorly to assist with electrode lead wire placement.

**Slide 53:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - To achieve good visualization of the round window niche, the lateral lip of sinus tympani must be drilled away in front of the facial nerve. This is particularly important to achieve adequate visualization of the round window for correct placement of the cochleostomy.
> - This also provides sufficient access for the advance off stylet insertion technique.
> - Adrenaline soaked gelfoam is placed over the round window niche for mucosal vasoconstriction.
> - Then the surgeon goes to the other side of the operating table, to prepare the subperiosteal pocket and drill a well for the receiver-stimulator. At this time the methylene blue mark should be found, usually lying approximately at, or just posterior to, the line of the temporoparietal suture. Initially a broad and then a thin periosteal elevator are used to create the subperiosteal pocket, extending the pocket deep enough for the antenna coil, in line with the sinodural angle. The position and size of the implant seat is then determined using the recess checking gauge.

---

**Slide 54:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - The seat is then drilled; using cutting and diamond burrs, and a channel is created for the electrode cable feed through, to align with the sinodural angle. In young children the well is drilled to expose the underlying dura.
> - The proper shape, size and depth of the well are checked with the recess gauge and a silicone implant template, until a stable fit is confirmed. A channel for the electrode lead is drilled, and an overhang of bone is left at the sinodural angle, helping to secure and protect the lead. Tie holes may be drilled, according to the surgeon’s preferences. With the advent of newer implant models, with significantly thinner profiles and no medial pedeastal, drilling a well might not be necessary, and our current practice is to drill the electrode lead channel only. Care is required when creating the subperiosteal pocket, so it will allow for a tight fit of the receiver stimulator, so that undesired displacement of the receiver stimulator will not occur. After completing the drilling, copious irrigation is used to clear bone dust and blood from the well and pocket.

**Slide 56:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - The surgeon returns to the mastoid site of the operating table, to perform the cochleostomy.
> - The round window niche is identified, and if necessary, the lip of the niche drilled, to visualize the round window membrane itself.
> - Cochleostomy is then created by saucerising the bone immediately inferior and slightly anterior to the round window membrane.
> - It is preferable to expose first the endostium, and then to open it with a pick, this might be difficult however, because the endostium is very thin and easily opened with the burr. A measuring disc can be used to check the size of the cochleostomy.
> - The cochleostomy can be enlarged posteroinferiorly, using a 0.6 or 0.8 mm diamond burr, until the final cochleostomy size is just over 1 mm. Lower power magnification is used for the electrode insertion itself.
> - Fascia or periostium is harvested to be used later for the electrode seal.
> - Hemostasis is checked again, as monopolar cauterization must not be used with the implant in situ.
> - The receiver stimulator package is then positioned within the subperiosteal pocket and seat, checking that the device is stable and the electrode lead is located properly in the channel.

---

**Slide 57:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - The electrode lead is grasped with specially designed forceps, and positioned so the electrode contacts are orientated towards the modiolus. The electrode is gently advanced into the cochlea until the white mark has reached the level of the cochleostomy.
> - When the marker ribs reach the level of the cochleostomy, insertion is completed.

**Slide 58:**
> **4. Procedure of CI Surgery**
>
> - A smaller burr is then used to open the epitympanum and identify the incus short process.
> - Initially large cutting and diamond burrs are used to skeletonize the external auditory bony canal and the descendant segment of the facial nerve.
> - Progressively smaller cutting and diamond burrs will be used to open the facial recess. A diamond burr can be used close to the nerve.
> - A microscope is not needed for the initial cortical mastoidectomy. It is important to stress the need of meticulous hemostasis during the procedure. Small children usually have their mastoid partially filled with bone marrow.
> - It is important to stress that a wide approach to the facial recess is necessary. Before attempting to open the facial recess, the line of the chorda tympani nerve, the chorda-facial junction and the vertical segment of the facial nerve should all be able to be seen through a very thin layer of bone. Note that the base of the facial recess triangle is equally distant medial and lateral to the incus short process.
> - The facial recess is opened, using progressively smaller diamond burrs, the buttress is defined superiorly, and the recess is opened down to the chorda-facial junction, taking care to preserve the chorda tympani nerve, and leaving a thin shell of bone over the facial nerve.

**Slide 2:**
> **5. Complications of CI Surgery**
>
> ⑤ Cerebrospinal Fluid Fistula
> - This situation is encountered more commonly in the pediatric population, as it is related to malformed inner ears. The biggest problem associated with a CSF fistula is the potential for meningitis, therefore it is a situation that must be managed properly.
> - Some techniques to stop a gusher are: elevating the patient’s head, waiting until flow decreases spontaneously and then creating a good seal around the electrodes. Antibiotic use, both systemic and topical has been recommended in this situation.
>
> ⑥ Hardware Failure
> - One reason for failure is malposition or damage to the electrodes during insertion. This happens in only 0.5% of all children implanted, but is twice as much as in adults.
> - An unexpected situation is damage to the implant by head trauma. This situation is again more frequently encountered in children.

---

**Slide 3:**
> **5. Complications of CI Surgery**
>
> ① Balance Disorders and Instability
> - Vertigo is a rare occurrence in implanted children, and when present, it is usually temporary.
> - If persistently present, a perilymph fistula should be suspected.
> - A more common situation is instability.
> - But in children under 1 year old, this is also rare, since compensation occurs before the patient starts walking.
> - However, measures should be taken, especially in bilateral cases, to avoid falls and potential trauma and damage to the implant.
>
> ② Lesions to the Chorda Tympani Nerve
> - In most cases, including small children, it is possible to expose the nerve without damaging it, yet, occasionally it is necessary to sacrifice it in order to gain sufficient access to the middle ear.
> - This possible circumstance should be discussed with the parents, but it is unexpected that the patient will experience symptoms at all.

---

**Slide 4:**
> **5. Complications of CI Surgery**
>
> ③ Loss of Residual Hearing
> - Preserving residual hearing could have a positive consequence in performance and duration of the implant.
> - It is difficult to assess how much useful residual hearing there is in small patients.
> - Furthermore, how much of that hearing would have been stable in time if the patient did not receive an implant is impossible to fathom.
> - Encourage surgeons to implement a meticulous technique, an atraumatic access to the scala tympani and to utilize the advance off stylet technique of insertion in every case, so to maximize chances of hearing preservation.

**Slide 6:**
> **5. Complications of CI Surgery**
>
> ③ Meningitis
> - Implanted children exhibit an increased rate of meningitis compared to the general population.
> - Several reasons have been identified to explain this situation, including a particular model of implant that in fact was removed from the market, size of the cochleostomy, and malformations of the inner ear.
>
> ④ Facial Paralysis
> - Lesions to the facial nerve are rare, they occur in less than a 0.5%.
> - Nevertheless, this low incidence is achieved only in centers with a large experience in ear surgery.
> - Some suggestions for protecting the facial nerve are: check thoroughly the preoperative ear HRCT scan, take care of keeping a thin layer of bone covering the nerve, and use copious irrigation.
> - Although facial nerve monitoring does not replace surgical knowledge and experience, we believe that it should be used in every case, as the surgical team will gain adequate experience on its use and troubleshooting, and will be able to use it properly during cases that do require its use.

---

**Slide 7:**
> **5. Complications of CI Surgery**
>
> ① Implant Extrusion
> - It is usually a long-term complication.
> - In small children, very thin flaps and situations where the irrigation was compromised could be associated with this unexpected result.
> - Special consideration should also be taken for the pressure the external processor magnet can exert over the underlying skin. The magnet should be adjusted so it will not produce excessive pressure, which can induce avascular necrosis and in severe cases a possible extrusion of the implant.
>
> ② Implant Infection
> - There are several different forms of infection associated with CI, like wound infection, infection at the implant site, acute otitis media (AOM) and meningitis. All forms of infection should be managed with caution if serious problems derived from infection are to be avoided. There is a high rate of explantation in infected patients. Small incisions and more care to keep an aseptic technique have been crucial factors in reducing the rate of infections. Peri- and postop antibiotics should be routinely used.
